## 0.24.0

Released 2026-01-13

### Added

Added default implementations to guest capability traits. This means, in the most cases, guests
can be used without needing to implement the capability traits.

### Changed

Renamed this repo `qwasr` in anticipation of publishing to crates.io. All crates have been prefixed
with `qwasr-` to match the new name.

A number of bugs were fixed in the guest code, including:

- outgoing HTTP requests where the response body was not being read correctly
- resolved an issue with the `#[wasi_otel::instrument]` macro where guest traces and metrics were 
  not being exported.
